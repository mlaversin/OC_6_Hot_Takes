### OC / Project 6

This sixth project of my training program consists in building a secure api for a sauce review app.

### Project installation

1. Frontend

The frontend of the application is available [here](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Web-Developer-P6)

2. Backend

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

- Clone this repo in a backend folder and run `npm install`.

- You need to create a MongoDB database

- You need to create an .env file and an uploads folder in the root folder.

- You can then run the server with `npm start`.
